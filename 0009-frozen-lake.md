Frozen lake involves crossing a frozen lake from start to goal without falling into any holes by walking over the frozen lake. 

The player may not always move in the intended direction due to the slippery nature of the frozen lake.

Holes in the ice are distributed in set locations when using a pre-determined map or in random locations when a random map is generated.

The player makes moves until they reach the goal or fall in a hole.

The lake is slippery (unless disabled) so the player may move perpendicular to the intended direction sometimes
