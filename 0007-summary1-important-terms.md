1- Reinforcement learning agents can solve problems without predefined solutions or explicitly programmed actions and most importantly, WITHOUT large amounts of data

2- An agent needs to learn which things are okay to do and which are not to do.

3- Environment is the term (place, area, subject etc) with which our agent interacts. It provides challenges and the desired objective.

4- There are two main types of environments in RL: Discrete and continuous environments...
  
5- State space represents all possible states in which the agent and the environment find themselves at any given moment. The size of the state space depends on the environment type.

6- The action space is all the things our agent can do in the environment.

7- Our agent needs rewards to achieve its overall goal. Most RL problems have pre-defined rewards. Rewards can be positive or negative.

8- A collection of time steps is called an episode (epoch).

9- A classical dilemma in reinforcement learning: exploration vs. exploitation

10- Q-learning is a model-free algorithm that teaches agents the optimal winning strategy through smart interactions with the environment.
